        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our goal at Furr Finder is to find a FURRever home for all pets placed
          in animal shelters. Each year there are over hundreds of thousands of
          animals that are put down at shelters due to the fact there are too
          many pets and not enough space to keep them all. Our goal at Furr
          Finder is to make it easier for people to adopt shelter animals and
          support local community shelters. Remember to ADOPT don't SHOP!!
